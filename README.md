# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

The assignment was to build a mobile app with focus area sensors, API:s &
Sharing or Multiscreen/Navigation.

## The problem

I use onClick, subscribe, useEffect and accelerometer to make sure that the user
can both press a button as well as shake the smartphone to update the quotes.
With more time I would like to implement navigation and add more sensory
features and also make sure that if the person that is quoted does not belong to
any house the app renders only the name (without the comma after).
